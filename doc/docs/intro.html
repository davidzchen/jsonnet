<p>Use Jsonnet to organize your JSON data, or to help your users organize the data they send to you.
It is easy to integrate Jsonnet's library or commandline interpreter into existing systems that take
JSON or <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>.  Some example situations are application
configuration (files in etc), build systems, package definitions, configuration management systems,
and cloud deployment agents.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<p>Jsonnet is ideal when you need to derive new data from existing data with subtle changes.
This was hinted at in the above example.  A more comprehensive illustration is the simple build
configuration below.  An object <code>CCompiler</code> is defined, which is then specialized for GCC
and Clang.  These are used to help construct an array of build targets.</p>

<p>Note the example <a href="http://www.bracha.org/oopsla90.pdf">mixins</a> <code>Opt</code> and
<code>Dbg</code> that can be applied to add optimization flags.  Mixins are the ultimate form of
inheritance, as they can be combined arbitrarily via the <code>+</code> operator.  In simple cases,
they behave identically to conventional object-oriented languages like Java.</p>
